# masteringCodeDemo
A repo that helps demonstrate skills that web developer interviewers look for as per https://github.com/planetoftheweb/masteringcode 

## My process will be:
- checkout a new feature branch in this repo, by the name of the feature from the planetoftheweb/masteeringcode repo
- in the new branch, create a new folder by the name of the feature to be demonstrated with related readme.md including prefix
  - create feature readme
  - create a local branch for the feature being discussed in the planetoftheweb/masteringcode using `git branch <branch-name> origin/<branch-name>`
  - set up project (installing dependencies) in own commit, noting challenges and differences in readme.md for that feature
  - complete different lessons in project in separate commits
  - reproduce the feature from planetoftheweb/masteringcode in this repos related feature branch
- merge feature branch into master and push to remote

## Onlookers
Feel free to look at [commits](https://github.com/sprintup/masteringCodeDemo/commits/master) or the related feature's readme to see notes and successes as I work through these challenges.
