# masteringCodeDemo
I'm looking for my first software development position. I've been interning as a software developer for over 9 months and my internship is coming to an end. To demonstrate my competency, I'm going to try to reproduce at least 1 lesson a day from https://www.linkedin.com/learning/mastering-web-developer-interview-code?u=42275329 which can also be found here: https://github.com/planetoftheweb/masteringcode

## My daily process will be:
- checkout a new feature branch in this repo, by the name of the feature from the planetoftheweb/masteeringcode repo
- create a local branch for the feature being discussed in the planetoftheweb/masteringcode using `git branch <branch-name> origin/<branch-name>`
- reproduce the feature from planetoftheweb/masteringcode in this repos related feature branch
- merge feature branch into master
